This file will explain how the average layout of a scene should be.
It will also explain how to use the different tools in the scene editor. (Not yet finished)

---------------- Scene ----------------
A scene is a collection of nodes that are rendered together.




--------------- Nodes ----------------
Node:
    A node is a object that can be placed in the scene.
    In order to make a scene you require a root node.
    The root node is the node that is the parent of all other nodes.
    This node can be any node, but it is recommended to use either a GroupNode or a SceneNode (See below).
    If you do not use A SceneNode as your root node, the scene will default to 2D. 

GroupNode:
    A GroupNode is a node that can contain other nodes.
    It is used to group nodes together.
    It is also used to make a hierarchy of nodes.
    A GroupNode can be used as a root node.

SceneNode:
    This node comes in 2 flavors: SceneNode and SceneNode2D.
    The SceneNode is used to render a 3D scene.
    The SceneNode2D is used to render a 2D scene.

CameraNode:
    This node is used to render a scene from a certain point of view.
    It is used in 3D scenes.
    It is not used in 2D scenes.

LightNode:
    This node is used to add light to a scene.
    It can be used in both 2D and 3D scenes.
